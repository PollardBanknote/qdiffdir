== Getting qdiffdir ============================================================

The project is hosted on github.com under the PollardBanknote organization.

You can download it as a zip from http://github.com/PollardBanknote/qdiffdir
or use git to clone the repo.

== Building ====================================================================

qdiffdir is a Qt project and requires Qt. Also, some parts of it currently
assume a *nix operating system.

Tested on Centos 5 with Qt 4.7.4:

  mkdir qdiffdir-build                   # Make some directory to build in
  cd qdiffdir-build                      # Change into it
  qmake /path/to/your/copy/of/qdiffdir   # Run qmake to make a Makefile
  make                                   # Run make to compile the program
  cp qdiffdir /wherever/you/want         # "Install" the program

After this it's safe to delete the source code and build directory.
