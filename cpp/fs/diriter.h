/** An iterator for traversing directory contents
 *
 * This class can be used for iterating over the contents of a directory. The
 * parameterized constructor will make a "begin" iterator, and the default
 * constructor will make an "end" iterator. One can dereference an iterator
 * to get a directory_entry describing the file/subdirectory.
 *
 * @note The "." and ".." 'files' are ignored by this iterator, since they are
 * not 'in' the directory.
 *
 * @note These objects are not copyable
 *
 * @note Only end iterators are ever considered equal. In particular, two
 * directory_iterator-s constructed with the same argument may not point to the
 * same file.
